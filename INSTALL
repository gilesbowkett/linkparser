These instructions assume a UNIX or UNIX-like environment. This includes OS X;
it's built successfully on a Intel Core 2 Duo MacBook. We're not sure how to get
this to build under Windows. Suggestions welcomed.

First, you'll need the 'mkrf' library to build the C extension if you don't already 
have it installed. It's as simple as:

  $ sudo gem install mkrf

Once you have that installed, install the Abiword link-grammar library 
that comes with this source:

  $ tar -xvzf link-grammar-4.3.5.tar.gz
  $ cd link-grammar-4.3.5
  $ ./configure; make; sudo make install
  $ cd ..

A note about the link-grammar library: it's not the latest version. Giles forked this
project because the original project required you to run patch and provided a copy-paste
patch command that didn't work on his box. It seemed completely fucking insane to
distribute a file known to need patching, so he forked the library and put it on the
githubs. If you're a C wizard, look at updating the link-grammar version. The
distribution included here isn't really link-grammar 4.3.5; it's a fork of link-grammar
4.3.5, with some minor changes. Giles is not actually clever enough to tell you what
those changes are.

Now build, test, and install the Ruby library:

  $ rake
  $ sudo rake install

That's it!
